check BasicFlow.md



## Notes

We'll start from using Create React App()

If you need more details our guidance about how to work with React - please let me know.

Static data, aka json arrays will provided later, so you don't need to create it by self.

Homepage basic layout will be provided later.

## Important Notes
Use Sentry Releases to ship better code
Use git flow so we'll not intersect between developers
Use PR for pushing your code into master and I'll be a reviewer
Use bin-flow
For making react components ready for cross-projects we'll use Bit.
We'll use Jest + Enzyme for tests
We'll use Netlify in order to have ability review our pages online
We'll use Travis CI for setting up tests coverage
Send API calls to server. @TODO share with team API endpoints. for making calls use Axious.
For subscription service we'll use Paddle.js

Each component should looks simple and understandable
we should use ReactStrap.
You should create and maintain documentation
